# Currency Predictions - Machine Learning Basics

What the project below wants to show, is that the exchange rates of three currencies - EUR, USD and GBP
are indirectly linked and the current rate of each of them will interact with the rates of the other two.
The following project will try to prove the thesis by conducting an analysis in which, after teaching an algorithm with
dataset based on historical data from the selected period, it will try to predict, based on USD and GBP exchange rates,
EUR exchange rate with an accuracy below the standard deviation.
